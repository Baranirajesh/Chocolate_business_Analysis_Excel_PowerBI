Setup
Ensure you have the following tools installed:

Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning and manipulation.
Power BI Desktop: For creating the dashboard.

Business Request
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive dashboard that provides insights into the chocolate business. Some of the key business questions might include:

What are the sales trends of various chocolate products?
Which regions/customers are contributing the most to sales?
What is the profitability of each product?
Are there any seasonal patterns in sales?

User Stories
User stories describe the requirements from the perspective of the end users. For example:

As a sales manager, I want to see sales trends of different chocolate products over time so that I can identify which products are performing well.
As a regional manager, I want to know the performance of sales across different regions so that I can allocate resources effectively.
As a finance officer, I want to track profitability by product and region to make data-driven pricing and sales decisions.

Clean the Data using Excel
Steps to clean data in Excel:

Open the data in Excel: If the data used in the Power BI report is available in Excel format, open it for inspection.
Check for missing values: Identify and handle missing values (e.g., replace them with averages, remove rows/columns with too many missing entries).
Remove duplicates: Ensure that the dataset does not contain duplicate rows.
Data normalization: Make sure that data types are consistent (e.g., date formats, numerical formats, etc.).
Rename columns: Use meaningful column names to make the data easier to understand.
Handle outliers: Identify and handle outliers that could skew the analysis.
Save the cleaned data: Once the data is cleaned, save it in a CSV or Excel format to import into Power BI.

Create Dashboard in Power BI
Import Data: Import the cleaned dataset into Power BI Desktop.
Model the Data: Create relationships between different tables (if multiple tables are involved).
Create Visualizations: Add visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and KPIs to represent the business data.
Sales trends over time
Profit by product/region
Sales by region/customer
Add Slicers: Use slicers to filter data by specific dimensions, like product categories, regions, or time periods.
Design the Dashboard: Arrange the visuals logically, provide meaningful titles, and use colors appropriately to enhance readability.

Dashboard
The final dashboard should give clear, actionable insights into the chocolate business, helping the stakeholders to make informed decisions. The dashboard should include:

Key Metrics: Total sales, total profits, and growth rates.
Trend Analysis: Sales over time, segmented by product, region, or customer.
Profitability: Break down of profit by region or product category.
Filters: Interactive filters that allow users to drill down into the data for specific time periods or product types.
